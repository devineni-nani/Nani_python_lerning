'''
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:

Example'''
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

#Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

#Example
a = "Hello"
print(a)
