#Creating Variables
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
x=10
y="nani"
print(x,y)
#type 
print (type (x), type(y))
'''Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, 
and can even change type after they have been set, by using type casting '''
#Casting
a = str(3)    # a will be '3'
b = int(3)    # b will be 3
c = float(3)  # c will be 3.0
#Single or Double Quotes?
#String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
#Case-Sensitive
#Variable names are case-sensitive.
#This will create two variables:

a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
