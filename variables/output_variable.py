#The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

#To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

'''
You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:
'''
a = "Python is "
b = "best"
c =  a + b
print(c)

'''
If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:

Example'''
x = 5
y = "John"
#print(x + y) #error

'''For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

Example'''
A = 5
B = 10
print(A + B)
