#when we call the function, the control is transferred to the function where the variable named 'name' gets initialized and printed.
#As soon as the function exits and passes the control back to the main program, the variable 'name' is no longer in scope.
#This is how a local variable behaves, and is scope lies in local to the piece of code where itâ€™s defined
