Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard.

input ( prompt )
raw_input ( prompt )

input ( ) : This function first takes the input from the user and then evaluates the expression, 
which means Python automatically identifies whether user entered a string or a number or list. 
If the input provided is not correct then either syntax error or exception is raised by python.


How the input function works in Python :

When input() function executes program flow will be stopped until the user has given an input.
The text or message display on the output screen to ask a user to enter input value is optional i.e. the prompt, will be printed on the screen is optional.
Whatever you enter as input, input function convert it into a string. if you enter an integer value still input() function convert it into a string. You need to explicitly convert it into an integer in your code using typecasting.
